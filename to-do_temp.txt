# general
- text "your turn" & "fired at" is misaligned
- fleet icons aren't sized properly according to tile size on grid (submarine is largest and carrier is smallest)
- submarine text is overlapping

# controls screen
- carousel is good, but needs space in the middle to fit either a gif or generate a sample "turn" that performs the ability listed

# playing screen
- hovering over grid square doesn't change the color to indicate if that's the place to fire
- possible feature: for normal firing (player only) implement a 2 step firing process (select square -> ready)

# text
- "arrow keys / enter or mouse / ..." is too big and is in the wrong place (needs to be less disruptive to screen)
